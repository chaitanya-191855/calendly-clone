# **Scheduling Platform**

**(Calendly Clone)**  
*SDE Fullstack Assignment*

# **Description**

Build a functional scheduling/booking web application that closely replicates Calendly's design and user experience. The application should allow users to create event types, set their availability, and let others book time slots through a public booking page. Your implementation should visually resemble Calendly's UI patterns, layout structure, and interaction design.

# **AI Tools Usage**

You are **allowed and encouraged** to use AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or any other AI assistants for development. However, you **must understand every line of code** you submit and be prepared to explain your implementation decisions during the evaluation interview.

# **Technical Stack**

* **Frontend:** React.js or Next.js (Single Page Application)  
* **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js OR Python with FastAPI/Django  
* **Database:** PostgreSQL or MySQL (design your own schema)

# **Core Features (Must Have)**

## **1\. Event Types Management**

* Create event types with name, duration (in minutes), and URL slug  
* Edit and delete existing event types  
* List all event types on the scheduling page  
* Each event type should have a unique public booking link

## **2\. Availability Settings**

* Set available days of the week (e.g., Monday to Friday)  
* Set available time slots for each day (e.g., 9:00 AM \- 5:00 PM)  
* Set timezone for the availability schedule

## **3\. Public Booking Page**

* Month calendar view to select a date  
* Display available time slots for the selected date  
* Booking form to collect invitee's name and email  
* Prevent double booking of the same time slot  
* Booking confirmation page with meeting details

## **4\. Meetings Page**

* View upcoming meetings  
* View past meetings  
* Cancel a meeting

# **Good to Have (Bonus)**

* Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)  
* Multiple availability schedules  
* Date-specific hours (override availability for specific dates)  
* Rescheduling flow for existing meetings  
* Email notifications on booking confirmation/cancellation  
* Buffer time before/after meetings  
* Custom invitee questions on booking form

# **Important Notes**

* **UI Design:** Your application should closely resemble Calendly's design. Study Calendly's UI carefully before starting \- visit calendly.com to understand the user flows and interface patterns.  
* **No Login Required:** Assume a default user is logged in for the admin side (event types, availability, meetings). The public booking page is accessible without login.  
* **Sample Data:** Seed your database with sample event types and a few meetings.  
* **Database Design:** Design your own database schema. This will be evaluated.  
* **README File:** Include setup instructions, tech stack used, and any assumptions made.  
* **Original Work:** Plagiarism from existing repositories will result in immediate disqualification.

# **Submission**

* Upload your code to GitHub and ensure the repository is **public**  
* Deploy your application (Vercel, Netlify, Render, Railway, or any cloud service)  
* Submit both the GitHub repository link and the deployed application link

# **Evaluation Criteria**
